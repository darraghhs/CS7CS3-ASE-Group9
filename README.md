### Steps for making a contribution
1. Clone the repo to your local machine with `git clone` using either HTTPS or SSH
2. If you already have the repo cloned checkout the main branch with `git checkout main`
3. Make sure you have all the latest commits with `git pull`
4. Create a branch for you feature or bug fix with named after the JIRA ticket e.g. KAN-13: `git checkout -b KAN-13`
5. Make your changes then stage them: `git add <files to be staged>` or `git add .` for all changes files
6. Commit your changes and add a **meaningful** commit message starting with the ticket ID e.g `git commit -m "KAN-13 This is a meaningful commit message`
7. Push your branch to the remote repo **NOT** to the main branch: `git push origin KAN-13`
